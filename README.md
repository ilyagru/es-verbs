## Description

ES verbs app makes it easier to learn the tense forms of different spanish verbs. Everything is on the same page.

The app built with React. It uses create-react-app.
The app is fully progressive thanks to service-workers.

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [guide](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Data

The app uses my own data collected from over the Internet.
For now a few most used verbs such as *ser*, *ir*, *estar*, *poder*, etc. were added. More will be added later.

Pull requests with more verbs are welcome!
